<li><strong>Implementation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Create a Transit Gateway in the desired region.</li>
<li>Attach all the VPCs to the Transit Gateway.</li>
<li>Update route tables in each VPC to point to the Transit Gateway for inter-VPC communication.</li>
<li>Optionally, connect the Transit Gateway to a VPN or Direct Connect for on-premises connectivity.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: A company has a VPC in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) region and another VPC in the EU (Ireland) region. They want to establish secure communication between these VPCs.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Set up a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) in each VPC.</li>
<li>Establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection between the two VGWs.</li>
<li>Update route tables in each VPC to route traffic for the other VPC through the VPN connection.</li>

<li><strong>Implementation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Initiate a VPC peering connection from the development VPC to the production VPC.</li>
<li>Accept the peering connection in the production VPC.</li>
<li>Update route tables in both VPCs to allow traffic to and from each VPC over the peering connection.</li>

<li>Create a Direct Connect connection in the AWS Management Console.</li>
<li>Set up a Virtual Interface (VIF) to connect to their VPC.</li>
<li>Update the VPC route table to route traffic for the on-premises network over the Direct Connect connection.</li>
