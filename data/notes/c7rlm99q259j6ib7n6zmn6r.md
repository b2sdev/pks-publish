## AWS Transit Gateway

- **Scenario**: A multinational company has multiple VPCs across different regions and accounts, representing different departments and projects. They want a centralized way to manage connectivity among all these VPCs and their on-premises data centers.
- **Implementation**:
    * Create a Transit Gateway in the desired region.
    * Attach all the VPCs to the Transit Gateway.
    * Update route tables in each VPC to point to the Transit Gateway for inter-VPC communication.
    * Optionally, connect the Transit Gateway to a VPN or Direct Connect for on-premises connectivity.

## AWS Site-to-Site VPN

- **Scenario**: A company has a VPC in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) region and another VPC in the EU (Ireland) region. They want to establish secure communication between these VPCs.
- **Implementation**:
    * Set up a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) in each VPC.
    * Establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection between the two VGWs.
    * Update route tables in each VPC to route traffic for the other VPC through the VPN connection.

## VPC Peering

- **Scenario**: A startup has two VPCs in the US West (Oregon) region: one for their development environment and one for production. They want to allow the development environment to access a database in the production VPC without exposing it to the internet.
- **Implementation**:
    * Initiate a VPC peering connection from the development VPC to the production VPC.
    * Accept the peering connection in the production VPC.
    * Update route tables in both VPCs to allow traffic to and from each VPC over the peering connection.

## AWS Direct Connect

- **Scenario**: A financial institution with a data center in New York wants to have a dedicated, low-latency connection to their VPC in the US East (N. Virginia) region for high-frequency trading applications.
- **Implementation**:
    * Work with an AWS Direct Connect partner to establish a dedicated line from their data center to an AWS Direct Connect location.
    * Create a Direct Connect connection in the AWS Management Console.
    * Set up a Virtual Interface (VIF) to connect to their VPC.
    * Update the VPC route table to route traffic for the on-premises network over the Direct Connect connection.
