<h3 id="question-9">Question #9<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#question-9"></a></h3>
<p>A company is running an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that are accessed frequently for the first few days after the files are created. After 7 days the files are rarely accessed.
The total data size is increasing and is close to the company's total storage capacity. A solutions architect must increase the company's available storage space without losing low-latency access to the most recently accessed files. The solutions architect must also provide file lifecycle management to avoid future storage issues.</p>
<p>Which solution will meet these requirements?</p>
<p>A. Use AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS.</p>
<p>B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.</p>

<p>A company hosts a three-tier web application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone. The web application uses a self-managed MySQL database that is hosted on an EC2 instance to store data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. The MySQL database currently uses a 1 TB Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) EBS volume. The company expects traffic of 1,000 IOPS for both reads and writes at peak traffic.</p>
<p>The company wants to minimize any disruptions, stabilize performance, and reduce costs while retaining the capacity for double the IOPS. The company wants to move the database tier to a fully managed solution that is highly available and fault tolerant.</p>
<p>Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?</p>
<p>A. Use a Multi-AZ deployment of an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with an io2 Block Express EBS volume.</p>
<p>B. Use a Multi-AZ deployment of an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with a General Purpose SSD (gp2) EBS volume.</p>
<p>C. Use Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering access tiers.</p>

The solutions architect created the first backup by using the mysqldump utility to create a database dump. The solutions architect created the second backup by enabling the final DB snapshot option on RDS termination.</p>
<p>The company is now planning for a new test cycle and wants to create a new DB instance from the most recent backup. The company has chosen a MySQL-compatible edition ofAmazon Aurora to host the DB instance.</p>
<p>Which solutions will create the new DB instance? (Choose two.)</p>
<p>A. Import the RDS snapshot directly into Aurora.</p>
<p>B. Upload the RDS snapshot to Amazon S3. Then import the RDS snapshot into Aurora.</p>
<p>C. Upload the database dump to Amazon S3. Then import the database dump into Aurora.</p>
<p>D. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to import the RDS snapshot into Aurora.</p>
<p>E. Upload the database dump to Amazon S3. Then use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to import the database dump into Aurora.</p>
