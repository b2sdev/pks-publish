ACID stands for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

- `Atomicity` means that all transactions either succeed or fail completely.
- `Consistency` guarantees relate to how a given state of the data is observed by simultaneous operations.
- `Isolation` refers to how simultaneous operations potentially conflict with one another.
- `Durability` means that committed changes are permanent.
